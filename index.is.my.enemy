<h1>About Kristal Amberose
</h1>
<p>Kristal is a plastic pollution researcher & activist.</p>
<p> She founded the Bahamas Plastic Movement (BPM). In 2012, Kristal went to study the Western Garbage Patch and it was worse than she had ever imagined. Upon returning she felt impassioned to raise awareness around the concentration of plastic on the beaches and in the seas - in her home of The Bahamas - so launched the BPM. It is a youth-led initiative, which aims to educate the next generation. They run free summer camps, with activities including trips out to sea to investigate how many micro-plastics are on the sea surface. They have also dissected mahi-mahi - a popular Bahamian fish - to find plastic in the stomachs. Not only is it inspiring youths, but because of Kristal, the Bahamian government has committed to banning all single-use plastics.
